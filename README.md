# Blackjack-game

This game was made using the help from the python programming for beginners from [FreeCodeAcademy](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-programming-course/)

From this course i revised over things such as

-Variables
-Expressions and Statements
-Comments
-Data Types
-Operators
-Arithmetic Operators
-Comparison Operators
-Boolean Operators
-Bitwise Operators
-is & in Operators
-Ternary Operator
-Strings
-String Methods
-F-strings
-Escaping Characters
-String Characters & Slicing
-Booleans
-Number Data Types
-Built-in Functions
-Enums
-User Input
-Control Statements
-Lists
-Sorting Lists
-Tuples
-Dictionaries
-Sets
-Functions
-Variable Scope
-Nested Functions
-Closures
-Objects
-Loops
-Break and Continue
-Classes
-Modules
-Arguments from Command Line
-Lambda Functions
-Map, Filter, Reduce
-Recursion
-Decorators
-Docstrings
-Annotations
-Exceptions
-With
-Installing Packages with pip
-List Compression
-Polymorphism
-Operator Overloading

New things I learned from the course would be the formating of code in python as i have mainly Java / C coding experience. The existance of F-strings in print statemements
and the use of dictionaries in python
